                The Skate Mat was founded by Kirk Owens in 2010. It all started out of his grandma's
                laundry mat. Grandma Irene was not only a grandma, 
                but a manager of this skate shop. She gripped boards and 
                sold skate supplies better than any grandma in the world. 
                West Side Coin Laundry was the one stop shop for your laundry
                and skate needs.

                After selling skate supplies all summer, Kirk decided to close up shop to go back 
                to school and 
                pursue an Accounting degree while Grandma Irene continued running Westside Coin Laundry.
                A couple years later, Grandma Irene passed away from natural causes...
                May she rest in peace.
                After almost 10 years of this company being establish, Kirk Owens
                decided to reopen The Skate Mat in loving memory of Grandma Irene. A company that
                was once just a skate shop out of his grandma's laundry mat is a now an
                online skate 
                shop for all your skate needs.
